# NeoEffects_library
Tools to support multiple concurrent effects on NeoPixel strips/rings.

Currently in early stages of moving from Glowaii prototyping to real library
Current code will not compile.

Intended use will be to create this as a library with several examples that can be pulled as a Zip and installed in arduino ide.
Examples are very incomplete at this point and need to be worked heavily before any use or real testing.
